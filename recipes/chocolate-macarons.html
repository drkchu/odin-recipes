    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 egg whites, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>6 oz. dark chocolate, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the powdered sugar, almond flour, and cocoa powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the granulated sugar to the egg whites, one tablespoon at a time, while continuing to beat on high speed. Beat until stiff peaks form and the mixture is shiny and glossy.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold the almond flour mixture into the egg whites in three batches, gently stirring until the mixture is smooth and forms a ribbon when lifted.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe small circles of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each one.</li>
        <li>Tap the baking sheet gently on the counter to release any air bubbles, then let the macarons rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes, until a thin film forms on the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake the macarons for 15-18 minutes, until they are set and the tops are firm to the touch. Let them cool completely on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache filling. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to simmer.</li>
        <li>Remove the cream from the heat and pour it over the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Let the mixture sit for a minute or two, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Chill the ganache in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, until it thickens and is easy to spread.</li>
        <li>Once the macarons are cool, pair them up by size and spread a small amount of the ganache on the flat side of one macaron. Sandwich the two halves together, pressing gently to distribute the filling evenly.</li>
        <li>Chill the macarons in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
