    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 (3-pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped shallots</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry (thawed)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
        <li>Season the beef tenderloin generously with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the beef and sear it on all sides until well browned, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the shallots and garlic, and sauté for 2 minutes until soft. Add the chopped mushrooms and butter, and cook for 5-7 minutes until the mushrooms are tender and the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the white wine and parsley, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is thickened.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Spread the Dijon mustard over the puff pastry.</li>
        <li>Spread the mushroom mixture evenly over the puff pastry, leaving a border of about 1 inch around the edges.</li>
        <li>Place the seared beef tenderloin in the center of the puff pastry. Roll the pastry around the beef, sealing the edges by pressing them together. Trim off any excess pastry.</li>
        <li>Brush the beaten egg over the top of the pastry.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Beef Wellington to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and crispy, and the beef is cooked to medium rare.</li>
        <li>Remove the Beef Wellington from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
